# Hand Tracking Module

This Python project implements a hand tracking module using the MediaPipe library for real-time hand detection and landmark identification. The module detects hand landmarks and displays them with real-time FPS on a video feed.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Features

- Real-time hand detection
- Identification of 21 hand landmarks
- Visualization of hand landmarks and connections
- Display of real-time frames per second (FPS)

## Usage

To use the module, ensure you have a connected video capture device. The module processes the video feed, identifies hand landmarks, and displays them on the video with real-time FPS.
